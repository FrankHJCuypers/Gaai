# Contributing

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.
There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Licensing agreement

All contributors retain the copyright to their contribution.
By contributing you give the *Gaai* project explicit permission to use and distribute your contributions as part of
the project.

## Coding conventions

The Kotlin code is formatted according to the official
[Kotlin style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
The only exceptions applied are:

+ A tab is 2 spaces instead of 4.
+ Line wrapping is applied after 120 characters in stead of 100.

The Android Studio project editor is set up to automatically apply this style.
Each time that a Kotlin file is saved or committed, it is also automatically reformatted.

## Testing

TBD
