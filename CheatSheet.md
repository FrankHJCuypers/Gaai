- ByteArray.toHexString() converts a byte array to a hexadecimal string representation
- String.hexToByteArray() converts a hexadecimal string representation to a byte array
- If WiFi connection to device does not work:  >adb connect 192.168.0.197:37193
- [Enable Developer mode on Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
  Instead of *USB debugging* you can also enable *Wireless debugging*, see
  [Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb)
- If `> adb devices` returns more then one device, then for adb commands that target a device, you 
  must specify the device with -s, like in `> adb -s 192.168.0.196:37473 bugreport zipFileName`.
- Capturing a BLE log and analyze it with WireShark:
  - On Android: 
    - goto Settings->Developer Options and enable *Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log*
    - Disable and enable bluetooth. If you forget this, then the BLE log will only contain truncated ATT messages.
    - Run Gaai and perform some bluetooth actions.
    - Close Gaai
  - On PC:
    - run `> adb bugreport zipFileName`. This will download a `zipFileName.zip` in the current directory.
    - Extract `FS\data\misc\bluetooth\logs\btsnoop_hci.log` from the zip file.
    - Open btsnoop_hci.log in WireShark.
- Wireshark: add Nexxtender Home BLE UUIDs.
  In Wireshark goto Edit->Preferences->Protocols->Bluetooth and press *Edit* after the 
  *Custom Bluetooth UUID names*. Here you can enter the UUIDs and corresponding names.
