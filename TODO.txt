    Can not be done everywhere; I tried it and failed. Needs to be done from within a context?
    See also how Nordic does it in their Android Common Library [https://github.com/NordicPlayground/Android-Common-Libraries/blob/main/permissions-ble/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/common/permissions/ble/view/BluetoothDisabledView.kt]
    It is part of the RequiredBluetooth & RequiredLocation used by the Nordic Kotlin-BLE-Library that I consulted to perform the BLE permissions in Gaai.
// TODO: Document all classes/functions in KDoc
// TODO: GaaiTopAppBar() is just plain text. Add color and maybe the Gaai pictogram?
// TODO: Move to the same logic as the ScannerView from the Nordic Kotlin-BLE-Library for Bluetooth permissions, using the  RequiredBluetooth & RequiredLocation composables.
    I tried it once, but it requires teh use of Hilt for dependency injection and some other Nordic stuff, so I abandoned it.
